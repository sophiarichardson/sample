## Epigraphs 

*To women that paint themselues*

Arthur Dowton

- A Lome wall and painted face are one;
- For th'beauty of them both is quickly gone.
- When the lome is fallen of, then lathes appeare,
- So wrinkles in that face fro th'eye to th'eare.
- The chastest of your sex contemne these arts,
- And many that vse them, haue rid in carts.
