## Editor's note

This version of *A Discourse against Painting and Tincturing of Women* was adapted from the *EEBO TCP* text. The [EEBO text](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A14007.0001.001?rgn=main;view=toc) does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and mostly has been modified only to modernize the spelling. More substantial editing in the works!

## Epigraphs

In the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, [^nantucket] at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with *Frederick Douglass*, the writer of the following Narrative. He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,—of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave,—he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.
