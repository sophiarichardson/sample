##Editor's Note
This version of *A Discourse against Painting and Tincturing of Women* was adapted from the *EEBO TCP* text. The [EEBO text](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A14007.0001.001?rgn=main;view=toc) does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and mostly has been modified only to modernize the spelling. More substantial editing in the works!

**To Painted Women**
>Edward Tylman

- Stay women-Gallants, cast an eye aside,
- See where a mirrour represents your pride.
- Not that your fardingales fill too much roome,
- Nor that your loftie tires you misbecome:
- Nor paps embossed layed forth to mens view:
- (Though that be vaine too, if wise men say true)
- But that ye haue renounc'd your natiue face,
- Vnder a colour that paint adds a grace,
- To your intising lookes. But ist no sinne,
- When Vermeil blushes to belie your skinne?
- Alas what comfort can your looking glasse
- Yeeld you, fond creatures, when it comes to passe
- That o're the paint is blurd, which makes you fret,
- Or yee see nought else but a counterfet,
- A shadow of your selfe? Why should you seeme
- Fairer then women? Men oft misesteeme
- Your sweetest beauties: for because they know
- Some of you are lesse beauteous, then they show.
- And who would willingly her beauty saint,
- Whose face ill-colour'd is clouded o're with paint?
- If ye be faire, what need of new complexion?
- If blacke, or wrinckled, learne what a confection
- The first, that was a Moralist doth learne you;
- Be vertuous, a bad face will nothing yerne you.
- Who would be vgly in heauens piercing sight,
- To seeme faire to some mortall partiall wight?
- Yet none so partiall, but he needes must see
- Vpon your brow folly and vanitie
- In their owne colours: and 'tis hard to find
- A painted face sort with a single mind.
